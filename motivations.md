Before starting at Turing, I was working in mechanical engineering. I enjoyed aspects of it, and worked to improve my mechanical engineering skillset to improve my options within ME, but after a few years, I started to consider other options - a friend suggested that I consider CS - this friend had actually been working a similar job to mine, and completed a bootcamp, and was very happy with his decision.  After doing much research, I decided to go this route as well - the logic of computer science appeals to me, and I'm looking forward to the rest of Turing, and working in the industry.
